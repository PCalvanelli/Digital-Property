# Preface: The Evolution of Property Rights

## Motivation for the Book

In 2016, nearly eight years after the global financial crisis, I found myself near a pile of collected ruins on my high school campus in New Jersey. The ruins were the remnants of a faux stone or concrete Greco-Roman building which had been carefully laid out by the school's administration to create a sense of history and tradition. My trip to these ruins was happenstance, as I was simply looking for a place to sit and reflect, away from the gravity of recent news that my family's home was in foreclosure. IRS agents had come to our house to seize our property, and the bank had been sending notices of foreclosure for months. The irony of the illustration now seems clear: faux ruins are just that, rubble that is meant to look real, but is not. Immitating value is not the same thing as having value.

The juxtaposition of these two events, the financial crisis and the ruins, led me to reflect on the nature of property rights and the role they play in shaping our lives. This book is the result of that reflection.

It was shortly after this period of reflection that I stumbled upon the work of a psuedo-anonymous economist and computer scientist who went by the name of "Satoshi Nakamoto". Nakamoto had written a white paper on a new form of digital currency, Bitcoin, which was designed to be a decentralized, peer-to-peer system that would allow for the transfer of value without the need for intermediaries. The system was built on a technology being coined as "blockchain", which was a distributed ledger that allowed for the secure and transparent recording of transactions. The implications of this technology at the time were not fully understood, but the idea that a system could establish a way for digital information to be owned without the need for intermediaries was fascinating to me. If this was a new form of property, what would it mean for the future of property rights?

The motivation for this book is to explore the evolution of property rights and the implications of new technologies on the way we think about ownership. The book will examine the historical development of property rights, the role of property in shaping societies, and the potential impact of emerging technologies on the future of ownership. By delving into the historical, legal, and technological dimensions of property rights, this book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the forces that have shaped our relationship with property and the potential transformations that lie ahead.

My hope is that this book will serve as a thought-provoking exploration of the complex and evolving nature of property. More importantly though, I hope is allows readers to reflect as I have been so fortunate to do from unforeseen circumstances, and to consider the implications of these reflections on the future of property rights.

I will attempt to provide as objective a view as possible, absent of any personal bias, and will strive to present a balanced and comprehensive analysis of the subject matter. I hope that this book will inspire readers to think critically about the nature of property rights and the role they play in our lives, and to engage in meaningful discussions about the future of ownership in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.
